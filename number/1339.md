## [LeetCode 1339](https://leetcode.com/problems/maximum-product-of-splitted-binary-tree/) Maximum Product of Splitted Binary Tree (medium)

- Given the `root` of a binary tree, split the binary tree into two subtrees by removing one edge such that the product of the sums of the subtrees is maximized.
- Return _the maximum product of the sums of the two subtrees_. Since the answer may be too large, return it **modulo** `10^9 + 7`.
- **Note** that you need to maximize the answer before taking the mod and not after taking it.
- **Example 1:**
    - <img src="https://assets.leetcode.com/uploads/2020/01/21/sample_1_1699.png"  />
    - **Input:** root = [1,2,3,4,5,6]
    - **Output:** 110
    - **Explanation:** Remove the red edge and get 2 binary trees with sum 11 and 10. Their product is 110 (11 * 10).
- **Example 2:**
    - <img src="https://assets.leetcode.com/uploads/2020/01/21/sample_2_1699.png"  />
    - **Input:** root = [1,null,2,3,4,null,null,5,6]
    - **Output:** 90
    - **Explanation:** Remove the red edge and get 2 binary trees with sum 15 and 6.Their product is 90 (15 * 6).
- **Constraints:**
    -   The number of nodes in the tree is in the range `[2, 5 * 10^4]`.
    -   `1 <= Node.val <= 10^4`

### Solution

```java
public int maxProduct(TreeNode root) {
    List<Integer> list = new ArrayList<>();
    int sum = getSum(root, list);
    long result = Long.MIN_VALUE;
    for (int num : list) {
        result = Math.max(result, (long) num * (sum - num));
    }
    return (int)(result % (1e9 + 7));
}

private int getSum(TreeNode root, List<Integer> list) {
    if (root == null) {
        return 0;
    }
    int sum = root.val + getSum(root.left, list) + getSum(root.right, list);
    list.add(sum);
    return sum;
}
```
