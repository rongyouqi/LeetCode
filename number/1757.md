## [LeetCode 1757](https://leetcode.com/problems/recyclable-and-low-fat-products/) Recyclable and Low Fat Products (easy)

- SQL Schema
    ```mysql
    Create table If Not Exists Products (product_id int, low_fats ENUM('Y', 'N'), recyclable ENUM('Y','N'))
    Truncate table Products
    insert into Products (product_id, low_fats, recyclable) values ('0', 'Y', 'N')
    insert into Products (product_id, low_fats, recyclable) values ('1', 'Y', 'Y')
    insert into Products (product_id, low_fats, recyclable) values ('2', 'N', 'Y')
    insert into Products (product_id, low_fats, recyclable) values ('3', 'Y', 'Y')
    insert into Products (product_id, low_fats, recyclable) values ('4', 'N', 'N')
    ```
- Table: `Products`
    ```
    +-------------+---------+
    | Column Name | Type    |
    +-------------+---------+
    | product_id  | int     |
    | low_fats    | enum    |
    | recyclable  | enum    |
    +-------------+---------+
    ```
    - product_id is the primary key for this table.
    - low_fats is an ENUM of type ('Y', 'N') where 'Y' means this product is low fat and 'N' means it is not.
    - recyclable is an ENUM of types ('Y', 'N') where 'Y' means this product is recyclable and 'N' means it is not.
- Write an SQL query to find the ids of products that are both low fat and recyclable.
- Return the result table in **any order**.
- The query result format is in the following example.
- **Example 1:**
    - **Input:** Products table:
        ```
        +-------------+----------+------------+
        | product_id  | low_fats | recyclable |
        +-------------+----------+------------+
        | 0           | Y        | N          |
        | 1           | Y        | Y          |
        | 2           | N        | Y          |
        | 3           | Y        | Y          |
        | 4           | N        | N          |
        +-------------+----------+------------+
        ```
    - **Output:**
        ```
        +-------------+
        | product_id  |
        +-------------+
        | 1           |
        | 3           |
        +-------------+
        ```
- **Explanation:** Only products 1 and 3 are both low fat and recyclable.

### Solution: `WHERE` and `AND`

```mysql
SELECT
	product_id
FROM
	Products
WHERE
	low_fats = 'Y' AND recyclable = 'Y';
```
