## [LeetCode 1066](https://leetcode.com/problems/campus-bikes-ii/) Campus Bikes II (medium)

- On a campus represented as a 2D grid, there are `n` workers and `m` bikes, with `n <= m`. Each worker and bike is a 2D coordinate on this grid.
- We assign one unique bike to each worker so that the sum of the **Manhattan distances** between each worker and their assigned bike is minimized.
- Return `the minimum possible sum of Manhattan distances between each worker and their assigned bike`.
- The **Manhattan distance** between two points `p1` and `p2` is `Manhattan(p1, p2) = |p1.x - p2.x| + |p1.y - p2.y|`.
- **Example 1:**
    - <img src="https://assets.leetcode.com/uploads/2019/03/06/1261_example_1_v2.png"  />
    - **Input:** workers = `[[0,0],[2,1]]`, bikes = `[[1,2],[3,3]]`
    - **Output:** 6
    - **Explanation:** We assign bike 0 to worker 0, bike 1 to worker 1. The Manhattan distance of both assignments is 3, so the output is 6.
- **Example 2:**
    - <img src="https://assets.leetcode.com/uploads/2019/03/06/1261_example_2_v2.png"  />
    - **Input:** workers = `[[0,0],[1,1],[2,0]]`, bikes = `[[1,0],[2,2],[2,1]]`
    - **Output:** 4
    - **Explanation:** We first assign bike 0 to worker 0, then assign bike 1 to worker 1 or worker 2, bike 2 to worker 2 or worker 1. Both assignments lead to sum of the Manhattan distances as 4.
- **Example 3:**
    - **Input:** workers = `[[0,0],[1,0],[2,0],[3,0],[4,0]]`, bikes = `[[0,999],[1,999],[2,999],[3,999],[4,999]]`
    - **Output:** 4995
- **Constraints:**
    -   `n == workers.length`
    -   `m == bikes.length`
    -   `1 <= n <= m <= 10`
    -   `workers[i].length == 2`
    -   `bikes[i].length == 2`
    -   `0 <= workers[i][0], workers[i][1], bikes[i][0], bikes[i][1] < 1000`
    -   All the workers and the bikes locations are **unique**.

### Solution

public int assignBikes(int[][] workers, int[][] bikes) {
    
}
