## [LeetCode 374](https://leetcode.com/problems/guess-number-higher-or-lower/) Guess Number Higher Or Lower (easy)

- We are playing the Guess Game. The game is as follows:
- I pick a number from `1` to `n`. You have to guess which number I picked.
- Every time you guess wrong, I will tell you whether the number I picked is higher or lower than your guess.
- You call a pre-defined API `int guess(int num)`, which returns three possible results:
    -   `-1`: Your guess is higher than the number I picked (i.e. `num > pick`).
    -   `1`: Your guess is lower than the number I picked (i.e. `num < pick`).
    -   `0`: your guess is equal to the number I picked (i.e. `num == pick`).
- Return _the number that I picked_.
- **Example 1:**
    - **Input:** n = 10, pick = 6
    - **Output:** 6
- **Example 2:**
    - **Input:** n = 1, pick = 1
    - **Output:** 1
- **Example 3:**
    - **Input:** n = 2, pick = 1
    - **Output:** 1
- **Constraints:**
    -   `1 <= n <= 2^31 - 1`
    -   `1 <= pick <= n`

### Solution

```java
/** 
 * Forward declaration of guess API.
 * @param  num   your guess
 * @return 	     -1 if num is higher than the picked number
 *			      1 if num is lower than the picked number
 *               otherwise return 0
 * int guess(int num);
 */

public class Solution extends GuessGame {
    public int guessNumber(int n) {
        int left = 1, right = n;
        while (left <= right) {
            int mid = left + (right - left) / 2;
            int temp = guess(mid);
            if (temp == 0) {
                return mid;
            } else if (temp > 0) {
                left = mid + 1;
            } else {
                right = mid - 1;
            }
        }
        return -1;
    }
}
