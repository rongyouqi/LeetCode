## [LeetCode 2500](https://leetcode.com/problems/delete-greatest-value-in-each-row/) Delete Greatest Value in Each Row (easy)

- You are given an `m x n` matrix `grid` consisting of positive integers.
- Perform the following operation until `grid` becomes empty:
    -   Delete the element with the greatest value from each row. If multiple such elements exist, delete any of them.
    -   Add the maximum of deleted elements to the answer.
- **Note** that the number of columns decreases by one after each operation.
- Return _the answer after performing the operations described above_.
- **Example 1:**
    - <img src="https://assets.leetcode.com/uploads/2022/10/19/q1ex1.jpg" style="zoom:67%;" />
    - **Input:** grid = `[[1,2,4],[3,3,1]]`
    - **Output:** 8
    - **Explanation:** The diagram above shows the removed values in each step.
        - In the first operation, we remove 4 from the first row and 3 from the second row (notice that, there are two cells with value 3 and we can remove any of them). We add 4 to the answer.
        - In the second operation, we remove 2 from the first row and 3 from the second row. We add 3 to the answer.
        - In the third operation, we remove 1 from the first row and 1 from the second row. We add 1 to the answer.
        - The final answer = 4 + 3 + 1 = 8.
- **Example 2:**
    - <img src="https://assets.leetcode.com/uploads/2022/10/19/q1ex2.jpg" style="zoom:67%;" />
    - **Input:** grid = `[[10]]`
    - **Output:** 10
    - **Explanation:** The diagram above shows the removed values in each step.
        - In the first operation, we remove 10 from the first row. We add 10 to the answer.
        - The final answer = 10.
- **Constraints:**
    -   `m == grid.length`
    -   `n == grid[i].length`
    -   `1 <= m, n <= 50`
    -   `1 <= grid[i][j] <= 100`

### Solution: 每行排序，每列求最大值

```java
public int deleteGreatestValue(int[][] grid) {
    for (int[] row : grid) {
        Arrays.sort(row);
    }
    int result = 0;
    for (int j = 0; j < grid[0].length; j++) {
        int max = Integer.MIN_VALUE;
        for (int i = 0; i < grid.length; i++) {
            max = Math.max(max, grid[i][j]);
        }
        result += max;
    }
    return result;
}
```
