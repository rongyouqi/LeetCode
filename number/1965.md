## [LeetCode 1965](https://leetcode.com/problems/employees-with-missing-information/) Employees with Missing Information (easy)

- SQL Schema
    ```mysql
    Create table If Not Exists Employees (employee_id int, name varchar(30))
    Create table If Not Exists Salaries (employee_id int, salary int)
    Truncate table Employees
    insert into Employees (employee_id, name) values ('2', 'Crew')
    insert into Employees (employee_id, name) values ('4', 'Haven')
    insert into Employees (employee_id, name) values ('5', 'Kristian')
    Truncate table Salaries
    insert into Salaries (employee_id, salary) values ('5', '76071')
    insert into Salaries (employee_id, salary) values ('1', '22517')
    insert into Salaries (employee_id, salary) values ('4', '63539')
    ```
- Table: `Employees`
    ```
    +-------------+---------+
    | Column Name | Type    |
    +-------------+---------+
    | employee_id | int     |
    | name        | varchar |
    +-------------+---------+
    ```
    - employee_id is the primary key for this table.
    - Each row of this table indicates the name of the employee whose ID is employee_id.
- Table: `Salaries`
    ```
    +-------------+---------+
    | Column Name | Type    |
    +-------------+---------+
    | employee_id | int     |
    | salary      | int     |
    +-------------+---------+
    ```
    - employee_id is the primary key for this table.
    - Each row of this table indicates the salary of the employee whose ID is employee_id.
- Write an SQL query to report the IDs of all the employees with **missing information**. The information of an employee is missing if:
    -   The employee's **name** is missing, or
    -   The employee's **salary** is missing.
- Return the result table ordered by `employee_id` **in ascending order**.
- The query result format is in the following example.
- **Example 1:**
    - **Input:**
        - Employees table:
            ```
            +-------------+----------+
            | employee_id | name     |
            +-------------+----------+
            | 2           | Crew     |
            | 4           | Haven    |
            | 5           | Kristian |
            +-------------+----------+
            ```
        - Salaries table:
            ```
            +-------------+--------+
            | employee_id | salary |
            +-------------+--------+
            | 5           | 76071  |
            | 1           | 22517  |
            | 4           | 63539  |
            +-------------+--------+
            ```
    - **Output:**
        ```
        +-------------+
        | employee_id |
        +-------------+
        | 1           |
        | 2           |
        +-------------+
        ```
    - **Explanation:**
        - Employees 1, 2, 4, and 5 are working at this company.
        - The name of employee 1 is missing.
        - The salary of employee 2 is missing.
