## [LeetCode 2442](https://leetcode.com/problems/count-number-of-distinct-integers-after-reverse-operations/) Count Number of Distinct Integers After Reverse Operations (medium)

- You are given an array `nums` consisting of **positive** integers.
- You have to take each integer in the array, **reverse its digits**, and add it to the end of the array. You should apply this operation to the original integers in `nums`.
- Return _the number of **distinct** integers in the final array_.
- **Example 1:**
    - **Input:** nums = [1,13,10,12,31]
    - **Output:** 6
    - **Explanation:** After including the reverse of each number, the resulting array is [1,13,10,12,31,1,31,1,21,13].
        - The reversed integers that were added to the end of the array are underlined. Note that for the integer 10, after reversing it, it becomes 01 which is just 1.
        - The number of distinct integers in this array is 6 (The numbers 1, 10, 12, 13, 21, and 31).
- **Example 2:**
    - **Input:** nums = [2,2,2]
    - **Output:** 1
    - **Explanation:** After including the reverse of each number, the resulting array is [2,2,2,2,2,2].
        - The number of distinct integers in this array is 1 (The number 2).
- **Constraints:**
    -   `1 <= nums.length <= 10^5`
    -   `1 <= nums[i] <= 10^6`

### Solution

```java
public int countDistinctIntegers(int[] nums) {
    Set<Integer> set = new HashSet<>();
    for (int num : nums) {
        set.add(num);
        set.add(reverse(num));
    }
    return set.size();
}

private int reverse(int num) {
    int result = 0;
    while (num != 0) {
        result = result * 10 + num % 10;
        num /= 10;
    }
    return result;
}
```
