## [LeetCode 587](https://leetcode.com/problems/erect-the-fence/) Erect the Fence (hard)

- You are given an array `trees` where `trees[i] = [xi, yi]` represents the location of a tree in the garden.
- You are asked to fence the entire garden using the minimum length of rope as it is expensive. The garden is well fenced only if **all the trees are enclosed**.
- Return _the coordinates of trees that are exactly located on the fence perimeter_.
- **Example 1:**
    - <img src="https://assets.leetcode.com/uploads/2021/04/24/erect2-plane.jpg" style="zoom:67%;" />
    - **Input:** points = `[[1,1],[2,2],[2,0],[2,4],[3,3],[4,2]]`
    - **Output:** `[[1,1],[2,0],[3,3],[2,4],[4,2]]`
- **Example 2:**
    - <img src="https://assets.leetcode.com/uploads/2021/04/24/erect1-plane.jpg" style="zoom:67%;" />
    - **Input:** points = `[[1,2],[2,2],[4,2]]`
    - **Output:** `[[4,2],[2,2],[1,2]]`
- **Constraints:**
    -   `1 <= points.length <= 3000`
    -   `points[i].length == 2`
    -   `0 <= xi, yi <= 100`
    -   All the given points are **unique**.
