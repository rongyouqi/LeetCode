## [LeetCode 328](https://leetcode.com/problems/odd-even-linked-list/) Odd Even Linked List (medium)

- Given the `head` of a singly linked list, group all the nodes with odd indices together followed by the nodes with even indices, and return _the reordered list_.
- The **first** node is considered **odd**, and the **second** node is **even**, and so on.
- Note that the relative order inside both the even and odd groups should remain as it was in the input.
- You must solve the problem in `O(1)` extra space complexity and `O(n)` time complexity.
- **Example 1:**
    - <img src="https://assets.leetcode.com/uploads/2021/03/10/oddeven-linked-list.jpg" style="zoom:67%;" />
    - **Input:** head = [1,2,3,4,5]
    - **Output:** [1,3,5,2,4]
- **Example 2:**
    - <img src="https://assets.leetcode.com/uploads/2021/03/10/oddeven2-linked-list.jpg" style="zoom:67%;" />
    - **Input:** head = [2,1,3,5,6,4,7]
    - **Output:** [2,3,6,7,1,5,4]
- **Constraints:**
    -   The number of nodes in the linked list is in the range `[0, 10^4]`.
    -   `-10^6 <= Node.val <= 10^6`

### Solution

```java
public ListNode oddEvenList(ListNode head) {
    if (head == null || head.next == null) {
        return head;
    }
    ListNode odd = head, even = head.next, evenHead = head.next;
    while (even != null && even.next != null) {
        odd.next = even.next;
        odd = odd.next;
        even.next = odd.next;
        even = even.next;
    }
    odd.next = evenHead;
    return head;
}
```

Time Complexity: O(n)

Space Complexity: O(1)
