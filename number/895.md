## [LeetCode 895](https://leetcode.com/problems/maximum-frequency-stack/) Maximum Frequency Stack (hard)

- Design a stack-like data structure to push elements to the stack and pop the most frequent element from the stack.
- Implement the `FreqStack` class:
    -   `FreqStack()` constructs an empty frequency stack.
    -   `void push(int val)` pushes an integer `val` onto the top of the stack.
    -   `int pop()` removes and returns the most frequent element in the stack.
        -   If there is a tie for the most frequent element, the element closest to the stack's top is removed and returned.
- **Example 1:**
    - **Input**
        - ["FreqStack", "push", "push", "push", "push", "push", "push", "pop", "pop", "pop", "pop"]
        - `[[], [5], [7], [5], [7], [4], [5], [], [], [], []]`
    - **Output** [null, null, null, null, null, null, null, 5, 7, 5, 4]
    - **Explanation**
        ```
        FreqStack freqStack = new FreqStack();
        freqStack.push(5); // The stack is [5]
        freqStack.push(7); // The stack is [5,7]
        freqStack.push(5); // The stack is [5,7,5]
        freqStack.push(7); // The stack is [5,7,5,7]
        freqStack.push(4); // The stack is [5,7,5,7,4]
        freqStack.push(5); // The stack is [5,7,5,7,4,5]
        freqStack.pop();   // return 5, as 5 is the most frequent. The stack becomes [5,7,5,7,4].
        freqStack.pop();   // return 7, as 5 and 7 is the most frequent, but 7 is closest to the top. The stack becomes [5,7,5,4].
        freqStack.pop();   // return 5, as 5 is the most frequent. The stack becomes [5,7,4].
        freqStack.pop();   // return 4, as 4, 5 and 7 is the most frequent, but 4 is closest to the top. The stack becomes [5,7].
        ```
- **Constraints:**
    -   `0 <= val <= 10^9`
    -   At most `2 * 10^4` calls will be made to `push` and `pop`.
    -   It is guaranteed that there will be at least one element in the stack before calling `pop`.

### Solution

```java
class FreqStack {
    Map<Integer, Integer> freq;
    Map<Integer, Deque<Integer>> map;
    int maxFreq;

    public FreqStack() {
        freq = new HashMap<>();
        map = new HashMap<>();
        maxFreq = 0;
    }
    
    public void push(int val) {
        int f = freq.getOrDefault(val, 0) + 1;
        freq.put(val, f);
        maxFreq = Math.max(maxFreq, f);
        map.computeIfAbsent(f, k -> new ArrayDeque<>()).offerLast(val);
    }
    
    public int pop() {
        int result = map.get(maxFreq).pollLast();
        freq.put(result, freq.get(result) - 1);
        if (map.get(maxFreq).isEmpty()) {
            maxFreq--;
        }
        return result;
    }
}
```
