## [LeetCode 875](https://leetcode.com/problems/koko-eating-bananas/) Koko Eating Bananas (medium)

- Koko loves to eat bananas. There are `n` piles of bananas, the `ith` pile has `piles[i]` bananas. The guards have gone and will come back in `h` hours.
- Koko can decide her bananas-per-hour eating speed of `k`. Each hour, she chooses some pile of bananas and eats `k` bananas from that pile. If the pile has less than `k` bananas, she eats all of them instead and will not eat any more bananas during this hour.
- Koko likes to eat slowly but still wants to finish eating all the bananas before the guards return.
- Return _the minimum integer_ `k` _such that she can eat all the bananas within_ `h` _hours_.
- **Example 1:**
    - **Input:** piles = [3,6,7,11], h = 8
    - **Output:** 4
- **Example 2:**
    - **Input:** piles = [30,11,23,4,20], h = 5
    - **Output:** 30
- **Example 3:**
    - **Input:** piles = [30,11,23,4,20], h = 6
    - **Output:** 23
- **Constraints:**
    -   `1 <= piles.length <= 10^4`
    -   `piles.length <= h <= 10^9`
    -   `1 <= piles[i] <= 10^9`

### Solution

```java
public int minEatingSpeed(int[] piles, int h) {
    int left = 1, right = 1;
    for (int pile : piles) {
        right = Math.max(right, pile);
    }
    while (left < right) {
        int mid = left + (right - left) / 2, temp = 0;
        for (int pile : piles) {
            temp += (pile + mid - 1) / mid;
        }
        if (temp > h) {
            left = mid + 1;
        } else {
            right = mid;
        }
    }
    return left;
}
```
