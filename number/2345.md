## [LeetCode 2345](https://leetcode.com/problems/finding-the-number-of-visible-mountains/) Finding the Number of Visible Mountains (medium)

- You are given a **0-indexed** 2D integer array `peaks` where `peaks[i] = [xi, yi]` states that mountain `i` has a peak at coordinates `(xi, yi)`. A mountain can be described as a right-angled isosceles triangle, with its base along the `x`-axis and a right angle at its peak. More formally, the **gradients** of ascending and descending the mountain are `1` and `-1` respectively.
- A mountain is considered **visible** if its peak does not lie within another mountain (including the border of other mountains).
- Return _the number of visible mountains_.
- **Example 1:**
    - <img src="https://assets.leetcode.com/uploads/2022/07/19/ex1.png"  />
    - **Input:** peaks = `[[2,2],[6,3],[5,4]]`
    - **Output:** 2
    - **Explanation:** The diagram above shows the mountains.
        - Mountain 0 is visible since its peak does not lie within another mountain or its sides.
        - Mountain 1 is not visible since its peak lies within the side of mountain 2.
        - Mountain 2 is visible since its peak does not lie within another mountain or its sides.
        - There are 2 mountains that are visible.
- **Example 2:**
    - <img src="https://assets.leetcode.com/uploads/2022/07/19/ex2new1.png"  />
    - **Input:** peaks = `[[1,3],[1,3]]`
    - **Output:** 0
    - **Explanation:** The diagram above shows the mountains (they completely overlap). Both mountains are not visible since their peaks lie within each other.
- **Constraints:**
    -   `1 <= peaks.length <= 10^5`
    -   `peaks[i].length == 2`
    -   `1 <= xi, yi <= 10^5`

### Solution

```java
public int visibleMountains(int[][] peaks) {
    Arrays.sort(peaks, (a, b) -> Integer.compare(a[0], b[0]));
    Deque<int[]> stack = new ArrayDeque<>();
    Map<Pair<Integer, Integer>, Integer> count = new HashMap<>();
    for (int[] peak : peaks) {
        Pair<Integer, Integer> p = new Pair<>(peak[0], peak[1]);
        count.put(p, count.getOrDefault(p, 0) + 1);
        while (!stack.isEmpty() && isCover(peak, stack.peekLast())) {
            stack.pollLast();
        }
        if (stack.isEmpty() || !isCover(stack.peekLast(), peak)) {
            stack.offerLast(peak);
        }
    }
    int result = 0;
    while (!stack.isEmpty()) {
        int[] peak = stack.pollLast();
        if (count.get(new Pair<>(peak[0], peak[1])) == 1) {
            result++;
        }
    }
    return result;
}

private boolean isCover(int[] a, int[] b) {
    // return true, if a covers b
    int left1 = a[0] - a[1], right1 = a[0] + a[1];
    int left2 = b[0] - b[1], right2 = b[0] + b[1];
    return left1 <= left2 && right2 <= right1;
}
```
