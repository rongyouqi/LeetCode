## [LeetCode 198](https://leetcode.com/problems/house-robber/) House Robber (medium)

- You are a professional robber planning to rob houses along a street. Each house has a certain amount of money stashed, the only constraint stopping you from robbing each of them is that adjacent houses have security systems connected and **it will automatically contact the police if two adjacent houses were broken into on the same night**.
- Given an integer array `nums` representing the amount of money of each house, return _the maximum amount of money you can rob tonight **without alerting the police**_.
- **Example 1:**
    - **Input:** nums = [1,2,3,1]
    - **Output:** 4
    - **Explanation:** Rob house 1 (money = 1) and then rob house 3 (money = 3).
        - Total amount you can rob = 1 + 3 = 4.
- **Example 2:**
    - **Input:** nums = [2,7,9,3,1]
    - **Output:** 12
    - **Explanation:** Rob house 1 (money = 2), rob house 3 (money = 9) and rob house 5 (money = 1).
        - Total amount you can rob = 2 + 9 + 1 = 12.
- **Constraints:**
    -   `1 <= nums.length <= 100`
    -   `0 <= nums[i] <= 400`

### Solution

```java
public int rob(int[] nums) {
    if (nums == null || nums.length == 0) {
        return 0;
    }
    if (nums.length == 1) {
        return nums[0];
    }
    int twoStep = nums[0], oneStep = Math.max(nums[0], nums[1]), result = oneStep;
    for (int i = 2; i < nums.length; i++) {
        result = Math.max(twoStep + nums[i], oneStep);
        twoStep = oneStep;
        oneStep = result;
    }
    return result;
}
```
