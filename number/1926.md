## [LeetCode 1926](https://leetcode.com/problems/nearest-exit-from-entrance-in-maze/) Nearest Exit from Entrance in Maze (medium)

- You are given an `m x n` matrix `maze` (**0-indexed**) with empty cells (represented as `'.'`) and walls (represented as `'+'`). You are also given the `entrance` of the maze, where `entrance = [entrancerow, entrancecol]` denotes the row and column of the cell you are initially standing at.
- In one step, you can move one cell **up**, **down**, **left**, or **right**. You cannot step into a cell with a wall, and you cannot step outside the maze. Your goal is to find the **nearest exit** from the `entrance`. An **exit** is defined as an **empty cell** that is at the **border** of the `maze`. The `entrance` **does not count** as an exit.
- Return _the **number of steps** in the shortest path from the_ `entrance` _to the nearest exit, or_ `-1` _if no such path exists_.
- **Example 1:**
    - <img src="https://assets.leetcode.com/uploads/2021/06/04/nearest1-grid.jpg" style="zoom:67%;" />
    - **Input:** maze = `[["+","+",".","+"],[".",".",".","+"],["+","+","+","."]]`, entrance = [1,2]
    - **Output:** 1
    - **Explanation:** There are 3 exits in this maze at [1,0], [0,2], and [2,3].
        - Initially, you are at the entrance cell [1,2].
        - You can reach [1,0] by moving 2 steps left.
        - You can reach [0,2] by moving 1 step up.
        - It is impossible to reach [2,3] from the entrance.
        - Thus, the nearest exit is [0,2], which is 1 step away.
- **Example 2:**
    - <img src="https://assets.leetcode.com/uploads/2021/06/04/nearesr2-grid.jpg" style="zoom:67%;" />
    - **Input:** maze = `[["+","+","+"],[".",".","."],["+","+","+"]]`, entrance = [1,0]
    - **Output:** 2
    - **Explanation:** There is 1 exit in this maze at [1,2].
        - [1,0] does not count as an exit since it is the entrance cell.
        - Initially, you are at the entrance cell [1,0].
        - You can reach [1,2] by moving 2 steps right.
        - Thus, the nearest exit is [1,2], which is 2 steps away.
- **Example 3:**
    - <img src="https://assets.leetcode.com/uploads/2021/06/04/nearest3-grid.jpg" style="zoom:67%;" />
    - **Input:** maze = `[[".","+"]]`, entrance = [0,0]
    - **Output:** -1
    - **Explanation:** There are no exits in this maze.
- **Constraints:**
    -   `maze.length == m`
    -   `maze[i].length == n`
    -   `1 <= m, n <= 100`
    -   `maze[i][j]` is either `'.'` or `'+'`.
    -   `entrance.length == 2`
    -   `0 <= entrancerow < m`
    -   `0 <= entrancecol < n`
    -   `entrance` will always be an empty cell.

### Solution: bfs

```java
public int nearestExit(char[][] maze, int[] entrance) {
    int[][] dirs = {{1, 0}, {-1, 0}, {0, 1}, {0, -1}};
    maze[entrance[0]][entrance[1]] = '+';
    Queue<int[]> queue = new ArrayDeque<>();
    queue.offer(new int[]{entrance[0], entrance[1], 0});
    while (!queue.isEmpty()) {
        int[] current = queue.poll();
        int row = current[0], col = current[1], distance = current[2];
        for (int[] dir : dirs) {
            int x = row + dir[0], y = col + dir[1];
            if (x < 0 || y < 0 || x >= maze.length || y >= maze[0].length || maze[x][y] == '+') {
                continue;
            }
            if (x == 0 || y == 0 || x == maze.length - 1 || y == maze[0].length - 1) {
                return distance + 1;
            }
            maze[x][y] = '+';
            queue.offer(new int[]{x, y, distance + 1});
        }
    }
    return -1;
}
```
