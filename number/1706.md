## [LeetCode 1706](https://leetcode.com/problems/where-will-the-ball-fall/) Where Will the Ball Fall (medium)

- You have a 2-D `grid` of size `m x n` representing a box, and you have `n` balls. The box is open on the top and bottom sides.
- Each cell in the box has a diagonal board spanning two corners of the cell that can redirect a ball to the right or to the left.
    -   A board that redirects the ball to the right spans the top-left corner to the bottom-right corner and is represented in the grid as `1`.
    -   A board that redirects the ball to the left spans the top-right corner to the bottom-left corner and is represented in the grid as `-1`.
- We drop one ball at the top of each column of the box. Each ball can get stuck in the box or fall out of the bottom. A ball gets stuck if it hits a "V" shaped pattern between two boards or if a board redirects the ball into either wall of the box.
- Return _an array_ `answer` _of size_ `n` _where_ `answer[i]` _is the column that the ball falls out of at the bottom after dropping the ball from the_ `ith` _column at the top, or_ `-1` _if the ball gets stuck in the box_.
- **Example 1:**
    - <img src="https://assets.leetcode.com/uploads/2019/09/26/ball.jpg" style="zoom:67%;" />
    - **Input:** grid = `[[1,1,1,-1,-1],[1,1,1,-1,-1],[-1,-1,-1,1,1],[1,1,1,1,-1],[-1,-1,-1,-1,-1]]`
    - **Output:** [1,-1,-1,-1,-1]
    - **Explanation:** This example is shown in the photo.
        - Ball b0 is dropped at column 0 and falls out of the box at column 1.
        - Ball b1 is dropped at column 1 and will get stuck in the box between column 2 and 3 and row 1.
        - Ball b2 is dropped at column 2 and will get stuck on the box between column 2 and 3 and row 0.
        - Ball b3 is dropped at column 3 and will get stuck on the box between column 2 and 3 and row 0.
        - Ball b4 is dropped at column 4 and will get stuck on the box between column 2 and 3 and row 1.
- **Example 2:**
    - **Input:** grid = `[[-1]]`
    - **Output:** [-1]
    - **Explanation:** The ball gets stuck against the left wall.
- **Example 3:**
    - **Input:** grid = `[[1,1,1,1,1,1],[-1,-1,-1,-1,-1,-1],[1,1,1,1,1,1],[-1,-1,-1,-1,-1,-1]]`
    - **Output:** [0,1,2,3,4,-1]
- **Constraints:**
    -   `m == grid.length`
    -   `n == grid[i].length`
    -   `1 <= m, n <= 100`
    -   `grid[i][j]` is `1` or `-1`.

### Solution

```java
public int[] findBall(int[][] grid) {
    int m = grid.length, n = grid[0].length;
    int[] result = new int[n];
    for (int col = 0; col < n; col++) {
        int current = col;
        for (int row = 0; row < m; row++) {
            int next = current + grid[row][current];
            if (next < 0 || next >= n || grid[row][current] != grid[row][next]) {
                current = -1;
                break;
            }
            current = next;
        }
        result[col] = current;
    }
    return result;
}
