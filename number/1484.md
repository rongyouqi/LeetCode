## [LeetCode 1484](https://leetcode.com/problems/group-sold-products-by-the-date/) Group Sold Products by the Date (easy)

- SQL Schema
    ```mysql
    Create table If Not Exists Activities (sell_date date, product varchar(20))
    Truncate table Activities
    insert into Activities (sell_date, product) values ('2020-05-30', 'Headphone')
    insert into Activities (sell_date, product) values ('2020-06-01', 'Pencil')
    insert into Activities (sell_date, product) values ('2020-06-02', 'Mask')
    insert into Activities (sell_date, product) values ('2020-05-30', 'Basketball')
    insert into Activities (sell_date, product) values ('2020-06-01', 'Bible')
    insert into Activities (sell_date, product) values ('2020-06-02', 'Mask')
    insert into Activities (sell_date, product) values ('2020-05-30', 'T-Shirt')
    ```
- Table `Activities`:
    ```
    +-------------+---------+
    | Column Name | Type    |
    +-------------+---------+
    | sell_date   | date    |
    | product     | varchar |
    +-------------+---------+
    ```
    - There is no primary key for this table, it may contain duplicates.
    - Each row of this table contains the product name and the date it was sold in a market.
- Write an SQL query to find for each date the number of different products sold and their names.
- The sold products names for each date should be sorted lexicographically.
- Return the result table ordered by `sell_date`.
- The query result format is in the following example.
- **Example 1:**
    - **Input:** Activities table:
        ```
        +------------+------------+
        | sell_date  | product     |
        +------------+------------+
        | 2020-05-30 | Headphone  |
        | 2020-06-01 | Pencil     |
        | 2020-06-02 | Mask       |
        | 2020-05-30 | Basketball |
        | 2020-06-01 | Bible      |
        | 2020-06-02 | Mask       |
        | 2020-05-30 | T-Shirt    |
        +------------+------------+
        ```
    - **Output:**
        ```
        +------------+----------+------------------------------+
        | sell_date  | num_sold | products                     |
        +------------+----------+------------------------------+
        | 2020-05-30 | 3        | Basketball,Headphone,T-shirt |
        | 2020-06-01 | 2        | Bible,Pencil                 |
        | 2020-06-02 | 1        | Mask                         |
        +------------+----------+------------------------------+
        ```
- **Explanation:**
    - For 2020-05-30, Sold items were (Headphone, Basketball, T-shirt), we sort them lexicographically and separate them by a comma.
    - For 2020-06-01, Sold items were (Pencil, Bible), we sort them lexicographically and separate them by a comma.
    - For 2020-06-02, the Sold item is (Mask), we just return it.

### Solution

```mysql
SELECT sell_date, COUNT(DISTINCT(product)) AS num_sold, GROUP_CONCAT(DISTINCT product ORDER BY product ASC SEPARATOR ',') AS products
FROM Activities
GROUP BY sell_date
ORDER BY sell_date ASC;
```
