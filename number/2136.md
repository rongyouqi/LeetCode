## [LeetCode 2136](https://leetcode.com/problems/earliest-possible-day-of-full-bloom/) Earliest Possible Day of Full Bloom (hard)

- You have `n` flower seeds. Every seed must be planted first before it can begin to grow, then bloom. Planting a seed takes time and so does the growth of a seed. You are given two **0-indexed** integer arrays `plantTime` and `growTime`, of length `n` each:
    -   `plantTime[i]` is the number of **full days** it takes you to **plant** the `ith` seed. Every day, you can work on planting exactly one seed. You **do not** have to work on planting the same seed on consecutive days, but the planting of a seed is not complete **until** you have worked `plantTime[i]` days on planting it in total.
    -   `growTime[i]` is the number of **full days** it takes the `ith` seed to grow after being completely planted. **After** the last day of its growth, the flower **blooms** and stays bloomed forever.
- From the beginning of day `0`, you can plant the seeds in **any** order.
- Return _the **earliest** possible day where **all** seeds are blooming_.
- **Example 1:**
    - <img src="https://assets.leetcode.com/uploads/2021/12/21/1.png"  />
    - **Input:** plantTime = [1,4,3], growTime = [2,3,1]
    - **Output:** 9
    - **Explanation:** The grayed out pots represent planting days, colored pots represent growing days, and the flower represents the day it blooms.
        - One optimal way is:
        - On day 0, plant the 0th seed. The seed grows for 2 full days and blooms on day 3.
        - On days 1, 2, 3, and 4, plant the 1st seed. The seed grows for 3 full days and blooms on day 8.
        - On days 5, 6, and 7, plant the 2nd seed. The seed grows for 1 full day and blooms on day 9.
        - Thus, on day 9, all the seeds are blooming.
- **Example 2:**
    - <img src="https://assets.leetcode.com/uploads/2021/12/21/2.png"  />
    - **Input:** plantTime = [1,2,3,2], growTime = [2,1,2,1]
    - **Output:** 9
    - **Explanation:** The grayed out pots represent planting days, colored pots represent growing days, and the flower represents the day it blooms.
        - One optimal way is:
        - On day 1, plant the 0th seed. The seed grows for 2 full days and blooms on day 4.
        - On days 0 and 3, plant the 1st seed. The seed grows for 1 full day and blooms on day 5.
        - On days 2, 4, and 5, plant the 2nd seed. The seed grows for 2 full days and blooms on day 8.
        - On days 6 and 7, plant the 3rd seed. The seed grows for 1 full day and blooms on day 9.
        - Thus, on day 9, all the seeds are blooming.
- **Example 3:**
    - **Input:** plantTime = [1], growTime = [1]
    - **Output:** 2
    - **Explanation:** On day 0, plant the 0th seed. The seed grows for 1 full day and blooms on day 2. Thus, on day 2, all the seeds are blooming.
- **Constraints:**
    -   `n == plantTime.length == growTime.length`
    -   `1 <= n <= 10^5`
    -   `1 <= plantTime[i], growTime[i] <= 10^4`

### Solution

- Imagine all flowers grow first (by themself), and then you need to start planting.
- You start by planting the flower that "grew" first, then you plant the next flower that "grew", and so on.

```java
public int earliestFullBloom(int[] plantTime, int[] growTime) {
    int n = plantTime.length;
    int[][] memo = new int[n][2];
    for (int i = 0; i < n; i++) {
        memo[i][0] = plantTime[i];
        memo[i][1] = growTime[i];
    }
    Arrays.sort(memo, (a, b) -> a[1] - b[1]);
    int result = 0;
    for (int i = 0; i < n; i++) {
        result = Math.max(result, memo[i][1]) + memo[i][0];
    }
    return result;
}
```
