## 1. [LeetCode 2455](https://leetcode.com/problems/average-value-of-even-numbers-that-are-divisible-by-three/) Average Value of Even Numbers That Are Divisible by Three (easy)

- Given an integer array `nums` of **positive** integers, return _the average value of all even integers that are divisible by_ `3`_._
- Note that the **average** of `n` elements is the **sum** of the `n` elements divided by `n` and **rounded down** to the nearest integer.
- **Example 1:**
    - **Input:** nums = [1,3,6,10,12,15]
    - **Output:** 9
    - **Explanation:** 6 and 12 are even numbers that are divisible by 3. (6 + 12) / 2 = 9.
- **Example 2:**
    - **Input:** nums = [1,2,4,7,10]
    - **Output:** 0
    - **Explanation:** There is no single number that satisfies the requirement, so return 0.
- **Constraints:**
    -   `1 <= nums.length <= 1000`
    -   `1 <= nums[i] <= 1000`

### Solution

```java
public int averageValue(int[] nums) {
    int sum = 0, count = 0;
    for (int num : nums) {
        if (num % 2 == 0 && num % 3 == 0) {
            sum += num;
            count++;
        }
    }
    return count == 0 ? 0 : sum / count;
}
```

## 2. [LeetCode 2456](https://leetcode.com/problems/most-popular-video-creator/) Most Popular Video Creator (medium)

- You are given two string arrays `creators` and `ids`, and an integer array `views`, all of length `n`. The `ith` video on a platform was created by `creator[i]`, has an id of `ids[i]`, and has `views[i]` views.
- The **popularity** of a creator is the **sum** of the number of views on **all** of the creator's videos. Find the creator with the **highest** popularity and the id of their **most** viewed video.
    -   If multiple creators have the highest popularity, find all of them.
    -   If multiple videos have the highest view count for a creator, find the lexicographically **smallest** id.
- Return _a 2D array of strings_ `answer` _where_ `answer[i] = [creatori, idi]` _means that_ `creatori` _has the **highest** popularity and_ `idi` _is the id of their most popular video._ The answer can be returned in any order.
- **Example 1:**
    - **Input:** creators = ["alice","bob","alice","chris"], ids = ["one","two","three","four"], views = [5,10,5,4]
    - **Output:** `[["alice","one"],["bob","two"]]`
    - **Explanation:**
        - The popularity of alice is 5 + 5 = 10.
        - The popularity of bob is 10.
        - The popularity of chris is 4.
        - alice and bob are the most popular creators.
        - For bob, the video with the highest view count is "two".
        - For alice, the videos with the highest view count are "one" and "three". Since "one" is lexicographically smaller than "three", it is included in the answer.
- **Example 2:**
    - **Input:** creators = ["alice","alice","alice"], ids = ["a","b","c"], views = [1,2,2]
    - **Output:** `[["alice","b"]]`
    - **Explanation:**
        - The videos with id "b" and "c" have the highest view count.
        - Since "b" is lexicographically smaller than "c", it is included in the answer.
- **Constraints:**
    -   `n == creators.length == ids.length == views.length`
    -   `1 <= n <= 10^5`
    -   `1 <= creators[i].length, ids[i].length <= 5`
    -   `creators[i]` and `ids[i]` consist only of lowercase English letters.
    -   `0 <= views[i] <= 10^5`

### Solution

```java
public List<List<String>> mostPopularCreator(String[] creators, String[] ids, int[] views) {
    Map<String, Long> mapViews = new HashMap<>();
    Map<String, Integer> highest = new HashMap<>();
    int n = creators.length;
    long max = 0;
    for (int i = 0; i < n; i++) {
        mapViews.put(creators[i], mapViews.getOrDefault(creators[i], 0L) + views[i]);
        max = Math.max(max, mapViews.get(creators[i]));
        if (highest.containsKey(creators[i])) {
            int index = highest.get(creators[i]);
            if (views[index] < views[i] || views[index] == views[i] && ids[i].compareTo(ids[index]) < 0) {
                highest.put(creators[i], i);
            }
        } else {
            highest.put(creators[i], i);
        }
    }
    List<List<String>> result = new ArrayList<>();
    for (Map.Entry<String, Long> e : mapViews.entrySet()) {
        if (e.getValue().equals(max)) {
            List<String> list = new ArrayList<>();
            String creator = e.getKey();
            list.add(creator);
            list.add(ids[highest.get(creator)]);
            result.add(list);
        }
    }
    return result;
}

## 3. [LeetCode 2457](https://leetcode.com/problems/minimum-addition-to-make-integer-beautiful/) Minimum Addition to Make Integer Beautiful (medium)

- You are given two positive integers `n` and `target`.
- An integer is considered **beautiful** if the sum of its digits is less than or equal to `target`.
- Return the _minimum **non-negative** integer_ `x` _such that_ `n + x` _is beautiful_. The input will be generated such that it is always possible to make `n` beautiful.
- **Example 1:**
    - **Input:** n = 16, target = 6
    - **Output:** 4
    - **Explanation:** Initially n is 16 and its digit sum is 1 + 6 = 7. After adding 4, n becomes 20 and digit sum becomes 2 + 0 = 2. It can be shown that we can not make n beautiful with adding non-negative integer less than 4.
- **Example 2:**
    - **Input:** n = 467, target = 6
    - **Output:** 33
    - **Explanation:** Initially n is 467 and its digit sum is 4 + 6 + 7 = 17. After adding 33, n becomes 500 and digit sum becomes 5 + 0 + 0 = 5. It can be shown that we can not make n beautiful with adding non-negative integer less than 33.
- **Example 3:**
    - **Input:** n = 1, target = 1
    - **Output:** 0
    - **Explanation:** Initially n is 1 and its digit sum is 1, which is already smaller than or equal to target.
- **Constraints:**
    -   `1 <= n <= 10^12`
    -   `1 <= target <= 150`
    -   The input will be generated such that it is always possible to make `n` beautiful.

### Solution

```java
public long makeIntegerBeautiful(long n, int target) {
    long num = n, base = 1;
    while (sum(num) > target) {
        num = num / 10 + 1;
        base *= 10;
    }
    return num * base - n;
}

private int sum(long num) {
    int result = 0;
    while (num > 0) {
        result += num % 10;
        num /= 10;
    }
    return result;
}
```

## 4. [LeetCode 2458](https://leetcode.com/problems/height-of-binary-tree-after-subtree-removal-queries/) Height of Binary Tree After Subtree Removal Queries (hard)

- You are given the `root` of a **binary tree** with `n` nodes. Each node is assigned a unique value from `1` to `n`. You are also given an array `queries` of size `m`.
- You have to perform `m` **independent** queries on the tree where in the `ith` query you do the following:
    -   **Remove** the subtree rooted at the node with the value `queries[i]` from the tree. It is **guaranteed** that `queries[i]` will **not** be equal to the value of the root.
- Return _an array_ `answer` _of size_ `m` _where_ `answer[i]` _is the height of the tree after performing the_ `ith` _query_.
- **Note**:
    -   The queries are independent, so the tree returns to its **initial** state after each query.
    -   The height of a tree is the **number of edges in the longest simple path** from the root to some node in the tree.
- **Example 1:**
    - <img src="https://assets.leetcode.com/uploads/2022/09/07/binaryytreeedrawio-1.png" style="zoom:67%;" />
    - **Input:** root = [1,3,4,2,null,6,5,null,null,null,null,null,7], queries = [4]
    - **Output:** [2]
    - **Explanation:** The diagram above shows the tree after removing the subtree rooted at node with value 4.
        - The height of the tree is 2 (The path 1 -> 3 -> 2).
- **Example 2:**
    - <img src="https://assets.leetcode.com/uploads/2022/09/07/binaryytreeedrawio-2.png" style="zoom:67%;" />
    - **Input:** root = [5,8,9,2,1,3,7,4,6], queries = [3,2,4,8]
    - **Output:** [3,2,3,2]
    - **Explanation:** We have the following queries:
        - Removing the subtree rooted at node with value 3. The height of the tree becomes 3 (The path 5 -> 8 -> 2 -> 4).
        - Removing the subtree rooted at node with value 2. The height of the tree becomes 2 (The path 5 -> 8 -> 1).
        - Removing the subtree rooted at node with value 4. The height of the tree becomes 3 (The path 5 -> 8 -> 2 -> 6).
        - Removing the subtree rooted at node with value 8. The height of the tree becomes 2 (The path 5 -> 9 -> 3).
- **Constraints:**
    -   The number of nodes in the tree is `n`.
    -   `2 <= n <= 10^5`
    -   `1 <= Node.val <= n`
    -   All the values in the tree are **unique**.
    -   `m == queries.length`
    -   `1 <= m <= min(n, 10^4)`
    -   `1 <= queries[i] <= n`
    -   `queries[i] != root.val`

### Solution

```java
public int[] treeQueries(TreeNode root, int[] queries) {
    Map<Integer, Integer> map = new HashMap<>();
    Map<Integer, Integer> leftMap = new HashMap<>();
    Map<Integer, Integer> rightMap = new HashMap<>();
    getHeight(root, 0, leftMap, rightMap);
    simulateRemove(root, 0, leftMap, rightMap, map);
    int[] result = new int[queries.length];
    for (int i = 0; i < queries.length; i++) {
        result[i] = map.get(queries[i]);
    }
    return result;
}

private int getHeight(TreeNode root, int height, Map<Integer, Integer> leftMap, Map<Integer, Integer> rightMap) {
    if (root == null) {
        return height - 1;
    }
    int left = getHeight(root.left, height + 1, leftMap, rightMap);
    leftMap.put(root.val, left);
    int right = getHeight(root.right, height + 1, leftMap, rightMap);
    rightMap.put(root.val, right);
    return Math.max(left, right);
}

private void simulateRemove(TreeNode root, int height, Map<Integer, Integer> leftMap, Map<Integer, Integer> rightMap, Map<Integer, Integer> map) {
    if (root == null) {
        return;
    }
    map.put(root.val, height);
    simulateRemove(root.left, Math.max(height, rightMap.get(root.val)), leftMap, rightMap, map);
    simulateRemove(root.right, Math.max(height, leftMap.get(root.val)), leftMap, rightMap, map);
}
```
