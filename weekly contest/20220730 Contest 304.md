## 1. [LeetCode 2357](https://leetcode.com/problems/make-array-zero-by-subtracting-equal-amounts/) Make Array Zero by Subtracting Equal Amounts (easy)

- You are given a non-negative integer array `nums`. In one operation, you must:
    -   Choose a positive integer `x` such that `x` is less than or equal to the **smallest non-zero** element in `nums`.
    -   Subtract `x` from every **positive** element in `nums`.
- Return _the **minimum** number of operations to make every element in_ `nums` _equal to_ `0`.
- **Example 1:**
    - **Input:** nums = [1,5,0,3,5]
    - **Output:** 3
    - **Explanation:**
        - In the first operation, choose x = 1. Now, nums = [0,4,0,2,4].
        - In the second operation, choose x = 2. Now, nums = [0,2,0,0,2].
        - In the third operation, choose x = 2. Now, nums = [0,0,0,0,0].
- **Example 2:**
    - **Input:** nums = [0]
    - **Output:** 0
    - **Explanation:** Each element in nums is already 0 so no operations are needed.
- **Constraints:**
    -   `1 <= nums.length <= 100`
    -   `0 <= nums[i] <= 100`

### Solution

```java
public int minimumOperations(int[] nums) {
    Set<Integer> set = new HashSet<>();
    for (int num : nums) {
        if (num > 0) {
            set.add(num);
        }
    }
    return set.size();
}
```

## 2. [LeetCode 2358](https://leetcode.com/problems/maximum-number-of-groups-entering-a-competition/) Maximum Number of Groups Entering a Competition (medium)

- You are given a positive integer array `grades` which represents the grades of students in a university. You would like to enter **all** these students into a competition in **ordered** non-empty groups, such that the ordering meets the following conditions:
    -   The sum of the grades of students in the `ith` group is **less than** the sum of the grades of students in the `(i + 1)th` group, for all groups (except the last).
    -   The total number of students in the `ith` group is **less than** the total number of students in the `(i + 1)th` group, for all groups (except the last).
- Return _the **maximum** number of groups that can be formed_.
- **Example 1:**
    - **Input:** grades = [10,6,12,7,3,5]
    - **Output:** 3
    - **Explanation:** The following is a possible way to form 3 groups of students:
        - 1st group has the students with grades = [12]. Sum of grades: 12. Student count: 1
        - 2nd group has the students with grades = [6,7]. Sum of grades: 6 + 7 = 13. Student count: 2
        - 3rd group has the students with grades = [10,3,5]. Sum of grades: 10 + 3 + 5 = 18. Student count: 3
        - It can be shown that it is not possible to form more than 3 groups.
- **Example 2:**
    - **Input:** grades = [8,8]
    - **Output:** 1
    - **Explanation:** We can only form 1 group, since forming 2 groups would lead to an equal number of students in both groups.
- **Constraints:**
    -   `1 <= grades.length <= 10^5`
    -   `1 <= grades[i] <= 10^5`

### Solution

```java
public int maximumGroups(int[] grades) {
    int result = 0, total = 0;
    while (total + result + 1 <= grades.length) {
        total += ++result;
    }
    return result;
}

## 3. [LeetCode 2359](https://leetcode.com/problems/find-closest-node-to-given-two-nodes/) Find Closest Node to Given Two Nodes (medium)

- You are given a **directed** graph of `n` nodes numbered from `0` to `n - 1`, where each node has **at most one** outgoing edge.
- The graph is represented with a given **0-indexed** array `edges` of size `n`, indicating that there is a directed edge from node `i` to node `edges[i]`. If there is no outgoing edge from `i`, then `edges[i] == -1`.
- You are also given two integers `node1` and `node2`.
- Return _the **index** of the node that can be reached from both_ `node1` _and_ `node2`_, such that the **maximum**between the distance from_ `node1` _to that node, and from_ `node2` _to that node is **minimized**_. If there are multiple answers, return the node with the **smallest** index, and if no possible answer exists, return `-1`.
- Note that `edges` may contain cycles.
- **Example 1:**
    - <img src="https://assets.leetcode.com/uploads/2022/06/07/graph4drawio-2.png"  />
    - **Input:** edges = [2,2,3,-1], node1 = 0, node2 = 1
    - **Output:** 2
    - **Explanation:** The distance from node 0 to node 2 is 1, and the distance from node 1 to node 2 is 1. The maximum of those two distances is 1. It can be proven that we cannot get a node with a smaller maximum distance than 1, so we return node 2.
- **Example 2:**
    - <img src="https://assets.leetcode.com/uploads/2022/06/07/graph4drawio-4.png"  />
    - **Input:** edges = [1,2,-1], node1 = 0, node2 = 2
    - **Output:** 2
    - **Explanation:** The distance from node 0 to node 2 is 2, and the distance from node 2 to itself is 0. The maximum of those two distances is 2. It can be proven that we cannot get a node with a smaller maximum distance than 2, so we return node 2.
- **Constraints:**
    -   `n == edges.length`
    -   `2 <= n <= 10^5`
    -   `-1 <= edges[i] < n`
    -   `edges[i] != i`
    -   `0 <= node1, node2 < n`

### Solution

```java
public int closestMeetingNode(int[] edges, int node1, int node2) {
    Map<Integer, Integer> map1 = new HashMap<>();
    Map<Integer, Integer> map2 = new HashMap<>();
    dfs(edges, node1, map1, 0);
    dfs(edges, node2, map2, 0);
    int result = -1, min = Integer.MAX_VALUE;
    for (int i = 0; i < edges.length; i++) {
        if (map1.containsKey(i) && map2.containsKey(i)) {
            int dist = Math.max(map1.get(i), map2.get(i));
            if (dist < min) {
                min = dist;
                result = i;
            }
        }
    }
    return result;
}

private void dfs(int[] edges, int node, Map<Integer, Integer> map, int dist) {
    if (map.containsKey(node) || node == -1) {
        return;
    }
    map.put(node, dist);
    dfs(edges, edges[node], map, dist + 1);
}
```

## 4. [LeetCode 2360](https://leetcode.com/problems/longest-cycle-in-a-graph/) Longest Cycle in a Graph (hard)

- You are given a **directed** graph of `n` nodes numbered from `0` to `n - 1`, where each node has **at most one** outgoing edge.
- The graph is represented with a given **0-indexed** array `edges` of size `n`, indicating that there is a directed edge from node `i` to node `edges[i]`. If there is no outgoing edge from node `i`, then `edges[i] == -1`.
- Return _the length of the **longest** cycle in the graph_. If no cycle exists, return `-1`.
- A cycle is a path that starts and ends at the **same** node.
- **Example 1:**
    - <img src="https://assets.leetcode.com/uploads/2022/06/08/graph4drawio-5.png"  />
    - **Input:** edges = [3,3,4,2,3]
    - **Output:** 3
    - **Explanation:** The longest cycle in the graph is the cycle: 2 -> 4 -> 3 -> 2. The length of this cycle is 3, so 3 is returned.
- **Example 2:**
    - <img src="https://assets.leetcode.com/uploads/2022/06/07/graph4drawio-1.png"  />
    - **Input:** edges = [2,-1,3,1]
    - **Output:** -1
    - **Explanation:** There are no cycles in this graph.
- **Constraints:**
    -   `n == edges.length`
    -   `2 <= n <= 10^5`
    -   `-1 <= edges[i] < n`
    -   `edges[i] != i`

### Solution

```java
public int longestCycle(int[] edges) {
    int result = -1;
    boolean[] visited = new boolean[edges.length];
    for (int i = 0; i < edges.length; i++) {
        if (visited[i]) {
            continue;
        }
        Map<Integer, Integer> map = new HashMap<>();
        for (int index = i, dist = 0; index != -1; index = edges[index]) {
            if (map.containsKey(index)) {
                result = Math.max(result, dist - map.get(index));
                break;
            }
            if (visited[index]) {
                break;
            }
            visited[index] = true;
            map.put(index, dist++);
        }
    }
    return result;
}
