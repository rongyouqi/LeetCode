## 1. [LeetCode 2460](https://leetcode.com/problems/apply-operations-to-an-array/) Apply Operations to an Array (easy)

- You are given a **0-indexed** array `nums` of size `n` consisting of **non-negative** integers.
- You need to apply `n - 1` operations to this array where, in the `ith` operation (**0-indexed**), you will apply the following on the `ith` element of `nums`:
    -   If `nums[i] == nums[i + 1]`, then multiply `nums[i]` by `2` and set `nums[i + 1]` to `0`. Otherwise, you skip this operation.
- After performing **all** the operations, **shift** all the `0`'s to the **end** of the array.
    -   For example, the array `[1,0,2,0,0,1]` after shifting all its `0`'s to the end, is `[1,2,1,0,0,0]`.
- Return _the resulting array_.
- **Note** that the operations are applied **sequentially**, not all at once.
- **Example 1:**
    - **Input:** nums = [1,2,2,1,1,0]
    - **Output:** [1,4,2,0,0,0]
    - **Explanation:** We do the following operations:
        - i = 0: nums[0] and nums[1] are not equal, so we skip this operation.
        - i = 1: nums[1] and nums[2] are equal, we multiply nums[1] by 2 and change nums[2] to 0. The array becomes [1,**4**,**0**,1,1,0].
        - i = 2: nums[2] and nums[3] are not equal, so we skip this operation.
        - i = 3: nums[3] and nums[4] are equal, we multiply nums[3] by 2 and change nums[4] to 0. The array becomes [1,4,0,**2**,**0**,0].
        - i = 4: nums[4] and nums[5] are equal, we multiply nums[4] by 2 and change nums[5] to 0. The array becomes [1,4,0,2,**0**,**0**].
        - After that, we shift the 0's to the end, which gives the array [1,4,2,0,0,0].
- **Example 2:**
    - **Input:** nums = [0,1]
    - **Output:** [1,0]
    - **Explanation:** No operation can be applied, we just shift the 0 to the end.
- **Constraints:**
    -   `2 <= nums.length <= 2000`
    -   `0 <= nums[i] <= 1000`

### Solution

```java
public int[] applyOperations(int[] nums) {
    for (int i = 0; i < nums.length - 1; i++) {
        if (nums[i] == nums[i + 1]) {
            nums[i] *= 2;
            nums[i + 1] = 0;
        }
    }
    int slow = 0;
    for (int fast = 0; fast < nums.length; fast++) {
        if (nums[fast] != 0) {
            nums[slow++] = nums[fast];
        }
    }
    while (slow < nums.length) {
        nums[slow++] = 0;
    }
    return nums;
}
```

## 2. [LeetCode 2461](https://leetcode.com/problems/maximum-sum-of-distinct-subarrays-with-length-k/) Maximum Sum of Distinct Subarrays With Length K (medium)

- You are given an integer array `nums` and an integer `k`. Find the maximum subarray sum of all the subarrays of `nums` that meet the following conditions:
    -   The length of the subarray is `k`, and
    -   All the elements of the subarray are **distinct**.
- Return _the maximum subarray sum of all the subarrays that meet the conditions__._ If no subarray meets the conditions, return `0`.
- _A **subarray** is a contiguous non-empty sequence of elements within an array._
- **Example 1:**
    - **Input:** nums = [1,5,4,2,9,9,9], k = 3
    - **Output:** 15
    - **Explanation:** The subarrays of nums with length 3 are:
        - [1,5,4] which meets the requirements and has a sum of 10.
        - [5,4,2] which meets the requirements and has a sum of 11.
        - [4,2,9] which meets the requirements and has a sum of 15.
        - [2,9,9] which does not meet the requirements because the element 9 is repeated.
        - [9,9,9] which does not meet the requirements because the element 9 is repeated.
        - We return 15 because it is the maximum subarray sum of all the subarrays that meet the conditions.
- **Example 2:**
    - **Input:** nums = [4,4,4], k = 3
    - **Output:** 0
    - **Explanation:** The subarrays of nums with length 3 are:
        - [4,4,4] which does not meet the requirements because the element 4 is repeated.
        - We return 0 because no subarrays meet the conditions.
- **Constraints:**
    -   `1 <= k <= nums.length <= 10^5`
    -   `1 <= nums[i] <= 10^5`

### Solution

```java
public long maximumSubarraySum(int[] nums, int k) {
    int[] count = new int[100001];
    long sum = 0;
    int index = -1;
    for (int i = 0; i < k; i++) {
        sum += nums[i];
        count[nums[i]]++;
        if (count[nums[i]] > 1) {
            index = i;
        }
    }
    long result = index == -1 ? sum : 0;
    for (int i = k; i < nums.length; i++) {
        sum += nums[i] - nums[i - k];
        count[nums[i]]++;
        count[nums[i - k]]--;
        if (count[nums[i]] > 1) {
            index = i;
        }
        if (i - k + 1 >= index) {
            result = Math.max(result, sum);
        }
    }
    return result;
}

## 3. [LeetCode 2462](https://leetcode.com/problems/total-cost-to-hire-k-workers/) Total Costs to Hire K Workers (medium)

- You are given a **0-indexed** integer array `costs` where `costs[i]` is the cost of hiring the `ith` worker.
- You are also given two integers `k` and `candidates`. We want to hire exactly `k` workers according to the following rules:
    -   You will run `k` sessions and hire exactly one worker in each session.
    -   In each hiring session, choose the worker with the lowest cost from either the first `candidates` workers or the last `candidates` workers. Break the tie by the smallest index.
        -   For example, if `costs = [3,2,7,7,1,2]` and `candidates = 2`, then in the first hiring session, we will choose the `4th` worker because they have the lowest cost `[[3,2],7,7,[**1**,2]]`.
        -   In the second hiring session, we will choose `1st` worker because they have the same lowest cost as `4th` worker but they have the smallest index `[[3,**2**],7,[7,2]]`. Please note that the indexing may be changed in the process.
    -   If there are fewer than candidates workers remaining, choose the worker with the lowest cost among them. Break the tie by the smallest index.
    -   A worker can only be chosen once.
- Return _the total cost to hire exactly_ `k` _workers._
- **Example 1:**
    - **Input:** costs = [17,12,10,2,7,2,11,20,8], k = 3, candidates = 4
    - **Output:** 11
    - **Explanation:** We hire 3 workers in total. The total cost is initially 0.
        - In the first hiring round we choose the worker from `[[17,12,10,**2**],7,[2,11,20,8]]`. The lowest cost is 2, and we break the tie by the smallest index, which is 3. The total cost = 0 + 2 = 2.
        - In the second hiring round we choose the worker from `[[17,12,10,7],[**2**,11,20,8]]`. The lowest cost is 2 (index 4). The total cost = 2 + 2 = 4.
        - In the third hiring round we choose the worker from `[[17,12,10,**7**],[11,20,8]]`. The lowest cost is 7 (index 3). The total cost = 4 + 7 = 11. Notice that the worker with index 3 was common in the first and last four workers.
        - The total hiring cost is 11.
- **Example 2:**
    - **Input:** costs = [1,2,4,1], k = 3, candidates = 3
    - **Output:** 4
    - **Explanation:** We hire 3 workers in total. The total cost is initially 0.
        - In the first hiring round we choose the worker from `[[**1**,2,4],[1]]`. The lowest cost is 1, and we break the tie by the smallest index, which is 0. The total cost = 0 + 1 = 1. Notice that workers with index 1 and 2 are common in the first and last 3 workers.
        - In the second hiring round we choose the worker from `[[2,4],[**1**]]`. The lowest cost is 1 (index 2). The total cost = 1 + 1 = 2.
        - In the third hiring round there are less than three candidates. We choose the worker from the remaining workers `[[**2**,4][]]`. The lowest cost is 2 (index 0). The total cost = 2 + 2 = 4.
        - The total hiring cost is 4.
- **Constraints:**
    -   `1 <= costs.length <= 10^5`
    -   `1 <= costs[i] <= 10^5`
    -   `1 <= k, candidates <= costs.length`

### Solution

```java
public long totalCost(int[] costs, int k, int candidates) {
    PriorityQueue<Integer> leftHeap = new PriorityQueue<>(), rightHeap = new PriorityQueue<>();
    int left = -1, right = costs.length;
    while (leftHeap.size() < candidates) {
        leftHeap.offer(costs[++left]);
    }
    while (left < right - 1 && rightHeap.size() < candidates) {
        rightHeap.offer(costs[--right]);
    }
    long result = 0;
    while (k > 0 && left < right - 1) {
        if (leftHeap.peek() <= rightHeap.peek()) {
            result += leftHeap.poll();
            leftHeap.offer(costs[++left]);
        } else {
            result += rightHeap.poll();
            rightHeap.offer(costs[--right]);
        }
        k--;
    }
    while (k > 0) {
        if (leftHeap.isEmpty()) {
            result += rightHeap.poll();
        } else if (rightHeap.isEmpty()) {
            result += leftHeap.poll();
        } else if (leftHeap.peek() <= rightHeap.peek()) {
            result += leftHeap.poll();
        } else {
            result += rightHeap.poll();
        }
        k--;
    }
    return result;
}

## 4. [LeetCode 2463](https://leetcode.com/problems/minimum-total-distance-traveled/) Minimum Total Distance Traveled (hard)

- There are some robots and factories on the X-axis. You are given an integer array `robot` where `robot[i]` is the position of the `ith` robot. You are also given a 2D integer array `factory` where `factory[j] = [position_j, limit_j]` indicates that `position_j` is the position of the `jth` factory and that the `jth` factory can repair at most `limit_j` robots.
- The positions of each robot are **unique**. The positions of each factory are also **unique**. Note that a robot can be **in the same position** as a factory initially.
- All the robots are initially broken; they keep moving in one direction. The direction could be the negative or the positive direction of the X-axis. When a robot reaches a factory that did not reach its limit, the factory repairs the robot, and it stops moving.
- **At any moment**, you can set the initial direction of moving for **some** robot. Your target is to minimize the total distance traveled by all the robots.
- Return _the minimum total distance traveled by all the robots_. The test cases are generated such that all the robots can be repaired.
- **Note that**
    -   All robots move at the same speed.
    -   If two robots move in the same direction, they will never collide.
    -   If two robots move in opposite directions and they meet at some point, they do not collide. They cross each other.
    -   If a robot passes by a factory that reached its limits, it crosses it as if it does not exist.
    -   If the robot moved from a position `x` to a position `y`, the distance it moved is `|y - x|`.
- **Example 1:**
    - <img src="https://assets.leetcode.com/uploads/2022/09/15/example1.jpg" style="zoom:67%;" />
    - **Input:** robot = [0,4,6], factory = `[[2,2],[6,2]]`
    - **Output:** 4
    - **Explanation:** As shown in the figure:
        - The first robot at position 0 moves in the positive direction. It will be repaired at the first factory.
        - The second robot at position 4 moves in the negative direction. It will be repaired at the first factory.
        - The third robot at position 6 will be repaired at the second factory. It does not need to move.
        - The limit of the first factory is 2, and it fixed 2 robots.
        - The limit of the second factory is 2, and it fixed 1 robot.
        - The total distance is |2 - 0| + |2 - 4| + |6 - 6| = 4. It can be shown that we cannot achieve a better total distance than 4.
- **Example 2:**
    - <img src="https://assets.leetcode.com/uploads/2022/09/15/example-2.jpg" style="zoom:67%;" />
    - **Input:** robot = [1,-1], factory = `[[-2,1],[2,1]]`
    - **Output:** 2
    - **Explanation:** As shown in the figure:
        - The first robot at position 1 moves in the positive direction. It will be repaired at the second factory.
        - The second robot at position -1 moves in the negative direction. It will be repaired at the first factory.
        - The limit of the first factory is 1, and it fixed 1 robot.
        - The limit of the second factory is 1, and it fixed 1 robot.
        - The total distance is |2 - 1| + |(-2) - (-1)| = 2. It can be shown that we cannot achieve a better total distance than 2.
- **Constraints:**
    -   `1 <= robot.length, factory.length <= 100`
    -   `factory[j].length == 2`
    -   `-10^9 <= robot[i], position_j <= 10^9`
    -   `0 <= limit_j <= robot.length`
    -   The input will be generated such that it is always possible to repair every robot.

### Solution

```java
public long minimumTotalDistance(List<Integer> robot, int[][] factory) {
    Collections.sort(robot);
    Arrays.sort(factory, (a, b) -> Integer.compare(a[0], b[0]));
    Long[][][] dp = new Long[robot.size() + 1][factory.length + 1][101];
    return helper(robot, factory, dp, 0, 0, 0);
}

private long helper(List<Integer> robot, int[][] factory, Long[][][] dp, int i, int j, int k) {
    if (i == robot.size()) {
        return 0;
    }
    if (j == factory.length) {
        return Long.MAX_VALUE;
    }
    if (dp[i][j][k] != null) {
        return dp[i][j][k];
    }
    long result1 = helper(robot, factory, dp, i, j + 1, 0);
    long result2 = Long.MAX_VALUE;
    if (factory[j][1] > k) {
        long temp = helper(robot, factory, dp, i + 1, j, k + 1);
        if (temp != Long.MAX_VALUE) {
            result2 = temp + Math.abs(robot.get(i) - factory[j][0]);
        }
    }
    dp[i][j][k] = Math.min(result1, result2);
    return dp[i][j][k];
}
```
