## 1. [LeetCode 2309](https://leetcode.com/problems/greatest-english-letter-in-upper-and-lower-case/) Greatest English Letter in Upper and Lower Case (easy)

- Given a string of English letters `s`, return _the **greatest** English letter which occurs as **both** a lowercase and uppercase letter in_ `s`. The returned letter should be in **uppercase**. If no such letter exists, return _an empty string_.
- An English letter `b` is **greater** than another letter `a` if `b` appears **after** `a` in the English alphabet.
- **Example 1:**
    - **Input:** s = "l**Ee**TcOd**E**"
    - **Output:** "E"
    - **Explanation:**
        - The letter 'E' is the only letter to appear in both lower and upper case.
- **Example 2:**
    - **Input:** s = "a**rR**AzFif"
    - **Output:** "R"
    - **Explanation:**
        - The letter 'R' is the greatest letter to appear in both lower and upper case.
        - Note that 'A' and 'F' also appear in both lower and upper case, but 'R' is greater than 'F' or 'A'.
- **Example 3:**
    - **Input:** s = "AbCdEfGhIjK"
    - **Output:** ""
    - **Explanation:**
        - There is no letter that appears in both lower and upper case.
- **Constraints:**
    -   `1 <= s.length <= 1000`
    -   `s` consists of lowercase and uppercase English letters.

### Solution

```java
public String greatestLetter(String s) {
    Set<Character> set = new HashSet<>();
    for (char c : s.toCharArray()) {
        set.add(c);
    }
    for (char c = 'Z'; c >= 'A'; c--) {
        if (set.contains(c) && set.contains(Character.toLowerCase(c))) {
            return "" + c;
        }
    }
    return "";
}
```

## 2. [LeetCode 2310](https://leetcode.com/problems/sum-of-numbers-with-units-digit-k/) Sum of Numbers With Units Digit K (medium)

- Given two integers `num` and `k`, consider a set of positive integers with the following properties:
    -   The units digit of each integer is `k`.
    -   The sum of the integers is `num`.
- Return _the **minimum** possible size of such a set, or_ `-1` _if no such set exists._
- Note:
    -   The set can contain multiple instances of the same integer, and the sum of an empty set is considered `0`.
    -   The **units digit** of a number is the rightmost digit of the number.
- **Example 1:**
    - **Input:** num = 58, k = 9
    - **Output:** 2
    - **Explanation:**
        - One valid set is [9,49], as the sum is 58 and each integer has a units digit of 9.
        - Another valid set is [19,39].
        - It can be shown that 2 is the minimum possible size of a valid set.
- **Example 2:**
    - **Input:** num = 37, k = 2
    - **Output:** -1
    - **Explanation:** It is not possible to obtain a sum of 37 using only integers that have a units digit of 2.
- **Example 3:**
    - **Input:** num = 0, k = 7
    - **Output:** 0
    - **Explanation:** The sum of an empty set is considered 0.
- **Constraints:**
    -   `0 <= num <= 3000`
    -   `0 <= k <= 9`

### Solution

```java
public int minimumNumbers(int num, int k) {
    if (num == 0) {
        return 0;
    }
    int x = num % 10;
    for (int i = 1; i <= 10; i++) {
        if ((i * k) % 10 == x) {
            if (i * k <= num) {
                return i;
            } else {
                return -1;
            }
        }
    }
    return -1;
}
```

## 3. [LeetCode 2311](https://leetcode.com/problems/longest-binary-subsequence-less-than-or-equal-to-k/) Longest Binary Subsequence Less Than or Equal to K (medium)

- You are given a binary string `s` and a positive integer `k`.
- Return _the length of the **longest** subsequence of_ `s` _that makes up a **binary** number less than or equal to_ `k`.
- Note:
    -   The subsequence can contain **leading zeroes**.
    -   The empty string is considered to be equal to `0`.
    -   A **subsequence** is a string that can be derived from another string by deleting some or no characters without changing the order of the remaining characters.
- **Example 1:**
    - **Input:** s = "1001010", k = 5
    - **Output:** 5
    - **Explanation:** The longest subsequence of s that makes up a binary number less than or equal to 5 is "00010", as this number is equal to 2 in decimal.
        - Note that "00100" and "00101" are also possible, which are equal to 4 and 5 in decimal, respectively.
        - The length of this subsequence is 5, so 5 is returned.
- **Example 2:**
    - **Input:** s = "00101001", k = 1
    - **Output:** 6
    - **Explanation:** "000001" is the longest subsequence of s that makes up a binary number less than or equal to 1, as this number is equal to 1 in decimal.
        - The length of this subsequence is 6, so 6 is returned.
- **Constraints:**
    -   `1 <= s.length <= 1000`
    -   `s[i]` is either `'0'` or `'1'`.
    -   `1 <= k <= 10^9`

### Solution

```java
public int longestSubsequence(String s, int k) {
    int result = 0, num = 1;
    for (int i = s.length() - 1; i >= 0; i--) {
        if (s.charAt(i) == '0' || num <= k) {
            k -= num * (s.charAt(i) - '0');
            result++;
        }
        if (num <= k) {
            num *= 2;
        }
    }
    return result;
}
```

## 4. [LeetCode 2312](https://leetcode.com/problems/selling-pieces-of-wood/) Selling Pieces of Wood (hard)

- You are given two integers `m` and `n` that represent the height and width of a rectangular piece of wood. You are also given a 2D integer array `prices`, where `prices[i] = [hi, wi, pricei]` indicates you can sell a rectangular piece of wood of height `hi` and width `wi` for `pricei` dollars.
- To cut a piece of wood, you must make a vertical or horizontal cut across the **entire** height or width of the piece to split it into two smaller pieces. After cutting a piece of wood into some number of smaller pieces, you can sell pieces according to `prices`. You may sell multiple pieces of the same shape, and you do not have to sell all the shapes. The grain of the wood makes a difference, so you **cannot** rotate a piece to swap its height and width.
- Return _the **maximum** money you can earn after cutting an_ `m x n`_piece of wood_.
- Note that you can cut the piece of wood as many times as you want.
- **Example 1:**
    - <img src="https://assets.leetcode.com/uploads/2022/04/27/ex1.png" style="zoom: 50%;" />
    - **Input:** m = 3, n = 5, prices = `[[1,4,2],[2,2,7],[2,1,3]]`
    - **Output:** 19
    - **Explanation:** The diagram above shows a possible scenario. It consists of:
        - 2 pieces of wood shaped 2 x 2, selling for a price of 2 * 7 = 14.
        - 1 piece of wood shaped 2 x 1, selling for a price of 1 * 3 = 3.
        - 1 piece of wood shaped 1 x 4, selling for a price of 1 * 2 = 2.
        - This obtains a total of 14 + 3 + 2 = 19 money earned.
        - It can be shown that 19 is the maximum amount of money that can be earned.
- **Example 2:**
    - <img src="https://assets.leetcode.com/uploads/2022/04/27/ex2new.png" style="zoom:50%;" />
    - **Input:** m = 4, n = 6, prices = `[[3,2,10],[1,4,2],[4,1,3]]`
    - **Output:** 32
    - **Explanation:** The diagram above shows a possible scenario. It consists of:
        - 3 pieces of wood shaped 3 x 2, selling for a price of 3 * 10 = 30.
        - 1 piece of wood shaped 1 x 4, selling for a price of 1 * 2 = 2.
        - This obtains a total of 30 + 2 = 32 money earned.
        - It can be shown that 32 is the maximum amount of money that can be earned.
        - Notice that we cannot rotate the 1 x 4 piece of wood to obtain a 4 x 1 piece of wood.
- **Constraints:**
    -   `1 <= m, n <= 200`
    -   `1 <= prices.length <= 2 * 10^4`
    -   `prices[i].length == 3`
    -   `1 <= hi <= m`
    -   `1 <= wi <= n`
    -   `1 <= pricei <= 10^6`
    -   All the shapes of wood `(hi, wi)` are pairwise **distinct**.

### Solution: dynamic programming

```java
public long sellingWood(int m, int n, int[][] prices) {
    long[][] dp = new long[m + 1][n + 1];
    for (int[] price : prices) {
        dp[price[0]][price[1]] = price[2];
    }
    for (int h = 1; h <= m; h++) {
        for (int w = 1; w <= n; w++) {
            for (int i = 1; i <= h / 2; i++) {
                dp[h][w] = Math.max(dp[h][w], dp[i][w] + dp[h - i][w]);
            }
            for (int i = 1; i <= w / 2; i++) {
                dp[h][w] = Math.max(dp[h][w], dp[h][i] + dp[h][w - i]);
            }
        }
    }
    return dp[m][n];
}
```
